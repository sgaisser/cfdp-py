    primarily responsible for receiving files sent from another CFDP entity. It performs the
    reception side of File Copy Operations.

    This handler supports both acknowledged and unacknowledged CFDP file transfers.
    The following core functions are the primary interface for interacting with the destination
    handler:

     1. :py:meth:`state_machine`: This state machine processes inserted packets while also
        generating the packets which need to be sent back to the initiator of a file copy
        operation. This call can also be used to insert packets into the destination
        handler. Please note that the destination handler can also only process Metadata, EOF and
        Prompt PDUs in addition to ACK PDUs where the acknowledged PDU is the Finished PDU.
        Right now, the handler processes one packet at a time, and each packer insertion needs
        another :py:meth:`state_machine` call.
     2. :py:meth:`get_next_packet`: Retrieve next packet to be sent back to the remote CFDP source
        entity.

    A new file transfer (Metadata PDU reception) is only be accepted if the handler is in the IDLE
    state. Furthermore, packet insertion is not allowed until all packets to send were retrieved
    after a state machine call.

    This handler is able to deal with file copy operations to directories, similarly to how the
    UNIX tool `cp` works. If the destination path is a directory instead of a regular  full path,
    the source path base file name will be appended to the destination path to form the resulting
    new full path.

    This handler also does not support concurrency out of the box but is flexible enough to be used
    in different concurrent contexts. For example, you can dynamically create new handlers and
    run them inside a thread pool, or move the newly created handler to a new thread."""
